      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Since I can remember, I’ve always had an interest in discovering new things. This made me develop a love for art, which I followed during my school years. After school I wanted a change so I moved to the UK which was completely different to the lifestyle I grew up with.
      I've had a love for tech from a young age and that interest lead to me taking the plunge to get into the industry. I’m surrounded <strong>by</strong> some excellent developers and by seeing what they do it encouraged me to try it out as well.
